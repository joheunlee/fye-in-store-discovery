Rey (Daisy Ridley) learns the ways of the Force from Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and develops a telepathic bond with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who is struggling to master the Dark Side. Meanwhile, Stormtrooper-turned-Resistance fighter Finn (John Boyega) teams up with pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and maintenance worker Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) for a risky mission behind enemy lines. Carrie Fisher, Domhnall Gleeson, Benicio Del Toro, Gwendoline Christie, and Laura Dern co-star. ~ Jack Rodgers, Rovi",
